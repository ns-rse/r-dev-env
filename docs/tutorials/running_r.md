This tutorial takes you through starting R in the workspace container.

## 1. Create a new file

Create a file in VS Code ending with a `.R` extension. You can create new files
by clicking on the new file icon in VS Code Explorer, or use the `code` command
in the terminal to create and open an R file

```bash
code R/test.R
```

You should see `R:(not attached)` in the Status Bar at the bottom of the
VSCode window.

## 2. Launch R

Click on the `R:(not attached)` link to launch an R terminal. You can then
send code from the `.R` file to the R terminal by pressing `cmd/ctrl + enter`.
